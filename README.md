# Steve Army
## Roadmap
- Connect to a (minecraft) server
- Send Packet
- Connect 1 bot to a server
- Connect multiple bot to a server

## Information
This project is a way for me to learn rust (in general), but more specifically async with tokio, how to send a packet and how minecraft protocol work.

If You want to help / give me some advice, you can make an issue!

## How to use it? (updated when new feature are implemented)
Build the project and then
```shell
Steve-Army --adress <adress|localhost> [-p <port>]
```
